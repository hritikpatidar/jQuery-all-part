types of traversing
1. child ------> parent traversing

    Traversing Up the DOM Tree
    three types of dom traversing
    1.parent()
        The parent() method returns the direct parent element of the selected element.

        This method only traverse a single level up the DOM tree.

        The following example returns the direct parent element of each <span>

    2.parents()
        The parents() method returns all ancestor elements of the selected element, all the way up to the document's root element (<html>).

        The  following example returns all ancestors of all <span>

    3.parentsUntil()
        The parentsUntil() method returns all ancestor elements between two given arguments.

        The following example returns all ancestor elements between a <span> and a <div>
    4. closest()
	Definition and Usage
	The closest() method returns the first ancestor of the selected element.

	An ancestor is a parent, grandparent, great-grandparent, and so on.
	
	The DOM tree: This method traverse upwards from the current element, all the way up to the document's root element (<html>), to find the first ancestor of DOM elements.

	This method is similar to parents(), in that they both traverse up the DOM tree. The differences are as follows:

	closest()

Begins with the current element
Travels up the DOM tree and returns the first (single) ancestor that matches the passed expression
The returned jQuery object contains zero or one element

2. parent -------> child traversing
    this is a desendents traversing
