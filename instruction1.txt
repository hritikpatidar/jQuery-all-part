What is jQuery?
jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.

The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.

jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.

jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.

The jQuery library contains the following features:

HTML/DOM manipulation
CSS manipulation
HTML event methods
Effects and animations
AJAX
Utilities



Why jQuery?
There are lots of other JavaScript libraries out there, but jQuery is probably the most popular, and also the most extendable.

Many of the biggest companies on the Web use jQuery, such as:

Google
Microsoft
IBM

What are Events?
All the different visitors' actions that a web page can respond to are called events.

An event represents the precise moment when something happens.
